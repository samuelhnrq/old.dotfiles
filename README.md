# My Dotfile

This might acutally be the billionth attempt at building my own rice, but this time I actually took the time to
backup and save my progress.

I use stow to manage these, you can trust bash parameter expanding to install them all with good-old `*` or you can enable specific components like so:
``` bash
stow -v --dotfiles vim
```
